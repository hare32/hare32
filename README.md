👨‍💻 Hi there! I'm an IT enthusiast currently honing my skills at the Technical University of Lodz, focusing on Java and JavaScript. Beyond my academic pursuits, I'm deeply passionate about exploring the ever-evolving landscape of new technologies. My tech toolkit includes Python, C++, XML, SQL, HTML, and CSS.

🏀 Outside of the digital realm, you'll find me immersed in the world of basketball, playing and officiating games. This experience enriches me with teamwork, effective communication, and the ability to thrive under pressure.

🌱 I'm driven by a strong desire to learn and grow, always eager to embrace new challenges with responsibility and meticulous organization.

📫 Keen to connect? I'm just a message away. Let's explore how we can create something amazing together!
